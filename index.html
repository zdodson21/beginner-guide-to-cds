        <h3>Media Ownership</h3>
        
        <p>
          In a world where streaming dominates the entertainment industry, people continue to lose grip on the ownership of their
          favorite forms of entertainment (movies, video games, music, etc.). When you stream music, you are "allowed" by a corporation
          to "rent" the music from them so long as you utilize their services. Even music purchased through a streaming service is still a
          "rental", because you can only use it so long as you follow their terms of service. Possessing the physical media (or at least the
          digital files) enables you to retake control over your favorite forms of entertainment.

        <h3>Preseravation</h3>

        <p>
          Nothing lasts forever, but we can make sure our favorite songs can last as long as they can. Large corporations rent out music through
          streaming services and "digital purchases" that are more like rentals than purchases. By ensuring you are ripping your CDs and purchasing
          digital music that provides you with the files for said music, you can ensure you can protect the entertainment you love. Even physical CDs
          are susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_rot" target="_blank">disc rot</a>, so making backups and copies is important to
          ensure the longevity of the music you enjoy.

        <h3>A Note on "Ripping" CDs</h3>

        <p>
          While "Ripping" is the official term used for acquiring the music off of a CD,
          it may lead some to belive that ripping music from a CD will cause it to be unusable
          in the future. Rest assured, the process of ripping a CD will only <em>copy</em> the
          audio files off of the source CD, leaving it perfectly usable when the process is complete.
          CDs can also be ripped multiple times, so if you need to rip your music into a different file
          format, you can do that as much as you wish!

        <h3>Software Options</h3>

        <p>
          <b>Note: </b> for the most part, only software <em><b>built-in</b></em> to an operating system will be recommended for convenience.
          There are many other options out there though, so do some research and choose what works best for you!

          <p>
            The current modern Windows Media Player application is missing some options when it comes to ripping music,
            so because of that the <em>Legacy</em> version of Windows Media Player is recommended. To easily enable the <em>Windows Media Player (Legacy)</em> application,
            copy and paste the following script into <em>PowerShell</em> (you must run <em>PowerShell</em> as an

            Because of the wide variety of Linux distrobutions, it is best you search for one that will work on the distro you use. However if you use 
            <em>Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint</em>, <em>Asunder</em> is a great choice.

              File size should not matter when burning music to a CD when using the <em>Audio CD</em>

          Utilizing `.wav` is not recommended due to its large file sizes and lack of support for metadata.
          However, if you run into issues with <em>.flac</em> files then <em>.wav</em> can be used instead.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Note: </b> The above use cases apply to phones as well. 
          Applications such as

            <li>
              Different CDs will allow different lengths of audio to be stored on them. 
              Your CD writing software should be able to detect the total length of audio storable,

          <p>
            <b>Important:</b> There is a function that Audio CD can use called "CD-Text".
            This function allows you to burn metadata to the CD for each audio file. Normally each file
            will display in a player as "Track 01", "Track 02", etc. CD-Text can change that display 
            track name, artist, etc., but it is not perfect and may not work properly (meaning that disc
            still plays but doesn't display metadata). Regardless of your attempts to utilize CD-Text, you
            should still write down the song order and keep it with your CD.
