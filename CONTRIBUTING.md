# Contributing

## What can I contribute?

Anything that can help beginner CD users better understand the process of using a CD, including but not limited to information about:

* Audio file formats (please stick to contributing information about the formats already in the web page)
* The process of ripping & burning CDs
* Anything that could benefit a *beginner* in the process. What do you wish you knew when you started taking control of the media you use?

## Rules

1. Keep content beginner friendly. Everyone has to start somewhere, this guide is for those who are just starting to learn.
2. Keep content relevant to the subject of CDs and audio.
3. Do not add or remove files from the current project structure. This is meant to be a basic and efficient (for readers) single page site. Anything that you edit should be within the `index.html` or `styles.css` file

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo and make your edits in your own local copy.
2. Open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes. I don't care too much about the format of your PR, just keep everything readable and detail the changes you made.
3. Understand that project maintainers reserve the right to edit, add, or remove information to align with the goal of keeping this web page beginner friendly.
